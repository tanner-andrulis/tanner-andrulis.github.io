I'm a Graduate Research Assistant at MIT advised by Profs. Vivienne Sze and Joel
Emer in the EEMS group. 

My research focuses on modeling and design of analog, compute-in-memory, and
photonic deep neural network accelerators. Through cross-stack co-design, I work
to develop lower-energy, higher-throughput systems.
