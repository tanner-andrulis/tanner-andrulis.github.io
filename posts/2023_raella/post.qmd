Processing-In-Memory (PIM) accelerators have the potential to efficiently run
Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference by reducing costly data movement and by
using resistive RAM (ReRAM) for efficient analog compute. Unfortunately, overall
PIM accelerator efficiency is limited by energy-intensive analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs). Furthermore, existing accelerators that reduce ADC cost do so
by changing DNN weights or by using low-resolution ADCs that reduce output
fidelity. These strategies harm DNN accuracy and/or require costly DNN
retraining to compensate.

To address these issues, we propose the RAELLA architecture. RAELLA adapts the
architecture to each DNN; it lowers the resolution of computed analog values by
encoding weights to produce near-zero analog values, adaptively slicing weights
for each DNN layer, and dynamically slicing inputs through speculation and
recovery. Low-resolution analog values allow RAELLA to both use efficient
low-resolution ADCs and maintain accuracy without retraining, all while
computing with fewer ADC converts.

Compared to other low-accuracy-loss PIM accelerators, RAELLA increases energy
efficiency by up to 4.9× and throughput by up to 3.3×. Compared to PIM
accelerators that cause accuracy loss and retrain DNNs to recover, RAELLA
achieves similar efficiency and throughput without expensive DNN retraining.
