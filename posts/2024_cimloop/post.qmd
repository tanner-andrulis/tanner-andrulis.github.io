**ISPASS 2024 Best Paper Award Winner**

Compute-In-Memory (CiM) is a promising solution to accelerate Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) as it can avoid energy-intensive DNN weight movement and use
memory arrays to perform low-energy, high-density computations. These benefits
have inspired research across the CiM stack, but CiM research often focuses on
only one level of the stack (*i.e.*, devices, circuits, architecture, workload,
or mapping) or only one design point (*e.g.*, one fabricated chip). There is a
need for a full-stack modeling tool to evaluate design decisions in the context
of full systems (e.g., see how a circuit impacts system energy) and to perform
rapid early-stage exploration of the CiM co-design space.

To address this need, we propose CiMLoop: an open-source tool to model diverse
CiM systems and explore decisions across the CiM stack. CiMLoop introduces
**(1)** a flexible specification that lets users describe, model, and map
workloads to both circuits and architecture, **(2)** an accurate energy model
that captures the interaction between DNN operand values, hardware data
representations, and analog/digital values propagated by circuits, and **(3)** a
fast statistical model that can explore the design space orders-of-magnitude
more quickly than other high-accuracy models.

Using CiMLoop, researchers can evaluate design choices at different levels of
the CiM stack, co-design across all levels, fairly compare different
implementations, and rapidly explore the design space.
