Photonics is a promising technology to accelerate Deep Neural Networks as it can use optical interconnects to reduce data movement energy and it enables low-energy, high-throughput optical-analog computations. To realize these benefits in a full system (accelerator + DRAM), designers must ensure that the benefits of using the electrical, optical, analog, and digital domains exceed the costs of converting data between domains. Designers must also consider system-level energy costs such as data fetch from DRAM. Converting data and accessing DRAM can consume significant energy, so to evaluate and explore the photonic system space, there is a need for a tool that can model these full-system considerations.

In this work, we show that similarities between Compute-in-Memory (CiM) and photonics let us use CiM system modeling tools to accurately model photonics systems. Bringing modeling tools to photonics enables evaluation of photonic research in a full-system context, rapid design space exploration, co-design, and comparison between systems.

Using our open-source model, we show that cross-domain conversion and DRAM can consume a significant portion of photonic system energy. We then demonstrate optimizations that reduce conversions and DRAM accesses to improve photonic system energy efficiency by up to 3x.
